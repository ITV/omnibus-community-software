omnibus-community-software
==========================

A place for [Omnibus](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus) software definitions provided by the community.

# Why?

Because Opscode [don't want to support software that they don't use](https://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/06/30/omnibus-a-look-forward/).

I think that's completely fine.

But I also think that Omnibus is a really useful tool and will benefit from more "examples in the wild".
